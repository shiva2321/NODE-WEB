# Graph Package

This Java package provides an implementation of a graph data structure optimized for handling very large graphs, with features including efficient memory usage, caching, and advanced algorithms for traversal and search. The graph is implemented using a combination of nodes and edges, and supports export to GraphML format for visualization.

## Features

- **Memory-efficient data structure**: Uses a combination of CSR representation and concurrent hash maps.
- **Efficient search and traversal**: Implements parallel BFS, A*, and bidirectional Dijkstra's algorithms.
- **Connected components detection**: Efficiently finds all connected components using the union-find algorithm.
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed nodes and subgraphs are cached in memory to reduce disk I/O.
- **Load balancing**: Distributes workload across multiple threads or machines for scalability.
- **Export to GraphML**: Allows exporting the graph structure to GraphML format for visualization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-package.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd graph-package
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Graph

To create a graph, you first need to instantiate the `Graph` class and add nodes and edges.

```java
Graph<String> graph = new Graph<>();
graph.addNode("1", "Node 1 Data");
graph.addNode("2", "Node 2 Data");
graph.addEdge("1", "2", 0.5f);
```

### Accessing Nodes and Edges

```java
Node<String> node1 = graph.getNode("1");
boolean edgeExists = graph.edgeExists("1", "2");
```

### Updating and Removing Nodes and Edges

```java
graph.updateEdgeStrength("1", "2", 0.8f);
graph.removeEdge("1", "2");
graph.removeNode("1");
```

### Traversal and Search

```java
// Breadth-First Search
graph.bfs("2");

// Depth-First Search
graph.dfs("2");

// Shortest Path
List<Node<String>> path = graph.shortestPath("2", "4");
path.forEach(node -> System.out.println(node.getId() + ": " + node.getData()));
```

### Finding Connected Components

```java
List<List<Node<String>>> components = graph.getConnectedComponents();
components.forEach(component -> {
    System.out.println("Component:");
    component.forEach(node -> System.out.println(node.getId() + ": " + node.getData()));
});
```

### Exporting to GraphML

```java
String graphML = graph.exportToGraphML();
System.out.println("GraphML Representation:");
System.out.println(graphML);
```

## Performance Considerations

- The package is designed to handle very large graphs efficiently, using memory-efficient data structures and caching.
- Parallel and distributed computing techniques can be employed to further improve performance for extremely large graphs.
